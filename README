Simple power monitoring using CurrentCost and rrdtoolcds

This repository is mainly here to keep a backup of the power usage monitoring
I have set up on my intranet. While anyone is welcome to make use of any
of the code in here it is completely unsupported and liable to change
any time I reconfigure my system. It's also hard-coded to match my setup.

The daemon reads data from a CurrentCost device and saves it in a
Round-robin Database using rrdtool. The web pages generate graphs from
the data to show current power usage (generated and imported from grid).

My system runs on a PogoPlug reflashed to boot Arch Linux, running on a
usb stick. To avoid wearing out the flash prematurely, I have set up my
system to write to the /tmp directory and use a cron job to copy the
rrd database to persistent storage once an hour.

This work was inspired by and derived from the information at
